# Linkora

[![CI](https://github.com/ijayabby/Linkora-social/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ijayabby/Linkora-social/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Linkora-socials is an early-stage open source SocialFi project built on Stellar with Soroban smart contracts. The current repository is focused on the protocol foundation: a Rust contract workspace that models creator profiles, follow relationships, social posts, token tipping, and community pools.

Linkora is an open-source SocialFi platform built on Stellar and Soroban. It combines social networking with on-chain financial primitives — creator profiles, follow graphs, posts, token tipping, community pools, and a mini app ecosystem — for creators, communities, and investors.

## Storage Layout

Linkora-socials uses Soroban's state storage to manage its data. All persistent storage keys are typed variants of the `StorageKey` enum defined with `#[contracttype]`, which provides compile-time key consistency and eliminates raw `Symbol` tuple keys.

### Storage Namespaces

- **Instance Storage**: Used for contract-wide configuration and small, frequently updated counters (e.g., admin address, post counter).
- **Persistent Storage**: Used for all user-generated data like profiles, posts, and social relationships. This data is subject to TTL extensions to remain on-chain.

### StorageKey Enum

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum StorageKey {
    Post(u64),              // persistent: post_id -> Post
    Profile(Address),       // persistent: user -> Profile
    Following(Address),     // persistent: user -> Vec<Address> they follow
    Followers(Address),     // persistent: user -> Vec<Address> following them
    Pool(Symbol),           // persistent: pool_id -> Pool
    Like(u64, Address),     // persistent: (post_id, user) -> bool
    AuthorPosts(Address),   // persistent: author -> Vec<u64> of post IDs
    Blocks(Address),        // persistent: blocker -> Map<Address, ()>
    UsernameIndex(String),  // persistent: username -> owner Address
    TipCooldown(u64, Address), // temporary: (post_id, tipper) -> last-tip ledger
}
```

### Key Mapping

| Key | StorageKey variant | Namespace | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Profile | `StorageKey::Profile(Address)` | Persistent | Stores user `Profile` data keyed by the owner's address. |
| UsernameIndex | `StorageKey::UsernameIndex(String)` | Persistent | Reverse index — maps each username to its owner `Address`, enforcing uniqueness. |
| Following | `StorageKey::Following(Address)` | Persistent | Stores a `Vec<Address>` of accounts that the given address follows. |
| Followers | `StorageKey::Followers(Address)` | Persistent | Stores a `Vec<Address>` of accounts following the given address. |
| Blocks | `StorageKey::Blocks(Address)` | Persistent | Stores a `Map<Address, ()>` of accounts blocked by the given address. |
| Post | `StorageKey::Post(u64)` | Persistent | Stores individual `Post` objects by their incremental ID. |
| Like | `StorageKey::Like(u64, Address)` | Persistent | Records whether a specific user has liked a specific post. |
| AuthorPosts | `StorageKey::AuthorPosts(Address)` | Persistent | Stores a `Vec<u64>` of post IDs created by the given author. |
| Pool | `StorageKey::Pool(Symbol)` | Persistent | Stores `Pool` data for named community pools. |
| TipCooldown | `StorageKey::TipCooldown(u64, Address)` | Temporary | Records the last-tip ledger sequence for `(post_id, tipper)`, enforcing the per-tipper-per-post cooldown window. Expires automatically. |
| `PROF_CT` | `Symbol("PROF_CT")` | Instance | Tracks the **total** profiles ever created (never decremented). See `get_profile_count`. |
| `POST_CT` | `Symbol("POST_CT")` | Instance | Tracks the total posts ever created (used for ID generation, never decremented). |
| `ADMIN` | `Symbol("ADMIN")` | Instance | Stores the contract administrator's address. |
| `TREASURY` | `Symbol("TREASURY")` | Instance | Stores the treasury address that receives protocol fees. |
| `FEE_BPS` | `Symbol("FEE_BPS")` | Instance | Stores the protocol fee in basis points (0–10 000). |
| `TIP_CD_W` | `Symbol("TIP_CD_W")` | Instance | Configurable tip cooldown window in ledgers (default ≈ 1 day). |
| `INIT` | `Symbol("INIT")` | Instance | Boolean flag indicating if the contract has been initialized. |

> [!NOTE]
> This storage layout is designed for the prototype phase and has not been optimized for large-scale data or minimal footprint.

---

## Getting Started

### One-command setup

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script checks prerequisites, installs JS dependencies, and builds the contracts. It is idempotent — safe to re-run after pulling changes.

### Manual setup

### One-command setup

The fastest way to get started is the setup script. It checks all prerequisites, installs JS dependencies, and builds the contracts:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script is idempotent — safe to run again after pulling new changes. It will print clear error messages for any missing tools and a next-steps summary on success.

### Manual setup

### 1. Install JavaScript Workspace Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Build the contracts

```bash
pnpm build:contracts
```

#### 3. Run contract tests

```bash
pnpm --filter contracts test
# or
cd packages/contracts && cargo test
```

#### 4. Start the web frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

#### 5. Start the mobile app

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm start
# Then press 'a' for Android emulator or 'i' for iOS simulator
```

See [docs/mobile/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./docs/mobile/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for full simulator setup and EAS build instructions.

#### 6. Start the indexer

```bash
cd services/indexer
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL and SOROBAN_RPC_URL
pnpm dev
```

See [docs/indexer/INDEXER_DESIGN.md](./docs/indexer/INDEXER_DESIGN.md) for PostgreSQL schema and environment variables.

## Available Scripts

From the repository root:

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start all services in development mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages |
| `pnpm build:contracts` | Build Soroban contracts only |
| `pnpm lint` | Run lint across all packages |
| `pnpm test` | Run all test suites |
| `pnpm format` | Format all source files |

---

## Smart Contract API Reference

## Makefile Targets

The repository root also includes a `Makefile` with thin wrappers around the existing workspace scripts:

- `make dev` runs the full local development stack.
- `make build` builds the workspace.
- `make lint` runs lint checks.
- `make test` runs the test suite.
- `make format` formats the workspace.

## Testing

### Data Models

- `Profile` — address, username, creator token address
- `Post` — id, author, content, tip total, timestamp, like count
- `Pool` — token address, balance, admin set, threshold

### Key Functions

Sandbox-backed integration tests with real transaction signing are available under `tests/integration`.

Run them from repository root:

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

See `tests/README.md` for setup details and CI guidance.

## Frontend Features

### Accessibility
All core flows (Feed, Profile, Pools, Explore) have undergone a comprehensive accessibility audit.
- Implemented `axe-core` and `jest-axe` for automated CI checks.
- Zero critical or serious accessibility violations.
- Key improvements include ARIA labeling, improved keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and semantic HTML structure.

### Playwright Testing
We use Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing of critical user flows. Tests are located in `packages/web/tests/e2e/`.
- **Feed Flow**: Wallet connection and post creation verification.
- **Profile Flow**: Profile navigation and user follow interactions.
- **Pool Flow**: Pool details and transaction mock flows.

Tests run automatically on PRs affecting the `packages/web` directory via the `.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml` GitHub action. To run tests locally:
```bash
cd packages/web
pnpm test:e2e
```

### SDK Client Usage
The `packages/sdk` module provides a fully typed `LinkoraClient` for both browser and Node.js environments. It exposes strongly-typed methods aligned with the smart contract ABI (e.g. `getProfile`, `getPost`, `getFollowing`).
```typescript
import { LinkoraClient } from "sdk";

const client = new LinkoraClient({
  contractId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID,
  rpcUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL,
});

const profile = await client.getProfile("GABC...");
```

### Transaction Notifications
A global context-driven notification system is available in `packages/web`. It handles transaction states seamlessly with:
- Pending status with spinners.
- Success and Error states with auto-dismiss after 4 seconds.
- Integrated Stellar Expert transaction links.
- Full ARIA live region support for accessibility.

## Security

Please review `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability disclosure guidance and scope.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@linkora.social](mailto:conduct@linkora.social).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

- **`pnpm` command not found**: Install pnpm globally using `npm install -g pnpm`. Linkora uses pnpm workspaces for managing multiple packages.
- **`stellar` command not found**: Install the Stellar CLI with `cargo install --locked stellar-cli`. Ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system PATH.
- **`cargo test` failing**: Make sure you are running it from inside `packages/contracts`. If you are at the repository root, use `pnpm test` instead.
- **Outdated dependencies**: Always run `pnpm install` from the root directory after pulling new changes to ensure your `node_modules` and Turborepo cache are synchronized.
- **Rust build errors**: Ensure the Wasm target is installed: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

### Command Reference

| Task | Root Directory | `packages/contracts` |
|---|---|---|
| **Install dependencies** | `pnpm install` | - |
| **Build Contracts** | `pnpm build:contracts` | `pnpm build` |
| **Run Tests** | `pnpm test` | `cargo test` |

## Deployment

A deployment script for Stellar Testnet is included at `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh`. It builds the contract WASM, deploys it to Testnet, and calls `initialize`.

### Required environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Secret key (`S...`) of the deployer / contract admin account |
| `TREASURY_ADDRESS` | Public address (`G...`) that receives protocol fees |
| `FEE_BPS` | Protocol fee in basis points (0–10 000). Defaults to `0`. |

### Usage

```bash
ADMIN_SECRET=S... \
TREASURY_ADDRESS=G... \
FEE_BPS=250 \
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

The script prints the deployed `contract_id` to stdout on success.

> **Note**: The account identified by `ADMIN_SECRET` must be funded on Testnet before running the script. Use [Stellar Testnet Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org) to fund it.

## Current Limitations

> Fund the deployer account first: [Stellar Testnet Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org)

- Pool withdrawal uses M-of-N admin authorization; more advanced governance may be needed for production.
- Contract storage layout has not been optimized for scale.
- No deployment scripts, frontend client, or backend service are included yet.
- Security review and audit work remain outstanding.

## Roadmap

1. **Contract hardening** — security review, edge-case coverage, upgrade path
2. **SDK completion** — full typed client aligned with contract ABI
3. **Indexer production-readiness** — pagination, rate limiting, event replay
4. **Mobile feature parity** — Pools screen, Post detail, Profile detail, compose flow
5. **Web feature parity** — Feed, profile pages, tip modal, compose modal
6. **Mini app registry** — on-chain or off-chain registry for third-party mini apps
7. **Mainnet deployment** — governance, treasury, and fee configuration
